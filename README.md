# Deep Learning
Most of the code in this repo was developed for [Assignment2](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment2/) of Stanford's course in Convolutional Neural Network for computer vision CS231n.
## Source
Contains all the code files
## Dataset
Contains [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data. All the demos
are using [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
## *FullyConnectedNets.ipynb*
The ipython notebook to demonstrate how to use the FullyConnectedNets function. Most of the code in this demo is developed by the course staff.  
## *ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb*
The ipython notebook to demonstrate how to use the ConvolutionalNetworks function. Most of the code in this demo is developed by the course staff.
## *vis_utils.py*
Some utilities to help us visualize the results. This was imported from [Assignment2](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment2/) folder in CS231n course.
